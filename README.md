We will create a sleepiness detection system using this Python project. Countless people use the highway at all hours of the day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, and long-distance travellers all suffer from sleep deprivation. As a result, driving when sleepy becomes extremely dangerous.

The majority of accidents occur as a result of the driver's tiredness. So, to avoid these collisions, we'll use Python, OpenCV, and Keras to create a system that will inform the driver when he gets tired orholding his phone while driving.

# files description
Detection_file :
  Has three files
detection_frontalface_alt: to detect the face of the driver 
Detection_lefteye_2splits :to detect left eye 
Detection_righteye_2splits :to detect left eye 

Models
Has only one .h file called cnn_classification used to classify whether the eyes closed or open 

Detect_drowiness 
Python file to play camera can run it to run the code 

Alarm 
The sound of the alarm when the user sleep or holding his phone
