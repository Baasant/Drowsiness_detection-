We will create a sleepiness detection system using this Python project. Countless people use the highway at all hours of the day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, and long-distance travellers all suffer from sleep deprivation. As a result, driving when sleepy becomes extremely dangerous.

The majority of accidents occur as a result of the driver's tiredness. So, to avoid these collisions, we'll use Python, OpenCV, and Keras to create a system that will inform the driver when he gets tired orholding his phone while driving.
